        <h2>Sorting by order<h2>
        <p>We've introduced a sorting by order enhancement in manage.php to improve the efficiency of managing job listings. This new feature allows users to sort job records based on different criteria
            ensuring quick access to relevant information. By clicking on the respective column headers, administrators can now seamlessly arrange job listings in ascending or descending order, making it easier to analyze and organize data. This enhancement enhances usability, reduces time spent searching for specific jobs, and provides a more streamlined management experience.</p>
