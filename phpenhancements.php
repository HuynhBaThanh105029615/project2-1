        <h2>Sorting by order<h2>
        <p>We've introduced a sorting by order enhancement in manage.php to improve the efficiency of managing job listings. This new feature allows users to sort job records based on different criteria
            ensuring quick access to relevant information. By clicking on the respective column headers, administrators can now seamlessly arrange job listings in ascending or descending order, making it easier to analyze and organize data. This enhancement enhances usability, reduces time spent searching for specific jobs, and provides a more streamlined management experience.</p>

        <h2>Register fuction<h2>
        <p>The register function in our system allows new users to create an account by providing their full name, username, and password through a simple registration form. This functionality ensures that only authorized users can access certain features of the platform. Upon submission, the system securely stores the user's credentials in the database, enabling future authentication. This process provides a seamless and secure way for users to join the system while maintaining data integrity and accessibility.</p>
